# Zdzichu Zadziorny

Hello there! I'm Zdzichu, a passionate programmer and cat enthusiast who currently navigates the complexities of being without a fixed address. Despite my current circumstances, I remain devoted to exploring the vast realms of technology, particularly through the lens of BASIC programming, while advocating for the welfare of my feline friends.

## üìö About Me

With a background that has taught me resilience, adaptability, and the power of community, I've developed a unique perspective on technology's role in society. I've found solace and expression in coding, especially in the simplicity and accessibility of BASIC. It's a language that reminds me of the importance of foundation and the beauty in starting from scratch.

My journey is also shared with the stray cats I've befriended along the way. Each one has taught me lessons in companionship, independence, and the unconditional love that often goes unnoticed in our day-to-day lives.

## üê± Feline Friends Initiative

In an effort to combine my passions, I've initiated a project aimed at supporting homeless cats. Utilizing BASIC, I'm developing simple, accessible applications for mobile devices that help local communities connect with cat rescue and adoption centers. My goal is to create a network of support that ensures these silent voices are heard and cared for.

## üñ•Ô∏è My Projects

- **Stray Saver**: An application that maps out feeding stations and shelters for stray cats, allowing kind-hearted souls to contribute or find a new companion.
- **CatLog Basic**: A lightweight, BASIC-programmed tool for managing the health and status of rescued cats, designed for easy use by shelters and rescues.

## ü§ù How You Can Help

I believe in the power of community and the difference we can make when we come together. If you're interested in supporting my projects, here's how you can help:

- **Spread the Word**: Share information about the Feline Friends Initiative and the importance of caring for our stray and homeless cat population.
- **Contribute**: Whether it's code contributions to improve the applications, sharing resources, or donating to cat shelters, every little bit helps.
- **Adopt or Foster**: Consider giving a forever home to a cat in need or fostering one temporarily.

## üì¢ Contact Me

While I might not have a permanent address, I am always reachable through this platform. Feel free to open an issue in this repo for inquiries about my projects, how you can contribute, or if you just want to have a chat about cats and coding!
